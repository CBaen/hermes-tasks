## What it does

Generates a compact machine-readable registry so agents can discover capability
ids, profiles, levels, maturity, watch status, tags, and paths without reading
every capability file.

## When to reach for it

Use this after adding, moving, promoting, or retrofitting capability files.

## How to use it

From the neutral system/user root, run:

```bash
python /home/guidingl/capabilities/tools/capability_registry.py --root /home/guidingl/capabilities --write-registry
```

For a project capability root, pass that root:

```bash
python /home/guidingl/capabilities/tools/capability_registry.py --root "<project>/capabilities" --write-registry
```

Read the terminal summary. `legacy` and `retrofit_needed` mean the file is still
usable, but it has not earned the v2 maturity fields yet.

## What it depends on

- [Current Truth Needs Evidence](../principles/current-truth-needs-evidence.md) - keeps generated registries from becoming proof.

## Failure modes

- A registry is a lookup aid, not the source of truth.
- Generated files can become stale if they are not regenerated after edits.
- Tags should help retrieval; they should not become a second documentation
  system.

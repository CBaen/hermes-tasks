## What it does

Prevents agents from creating or expanding giant catch-all files. A file with
too many responsibilities becomes harder to read, harder to verify, harder to
handoff, and easier to damage with partial-context edits.

## Law

NO MONOLITHS. Hand-authored production source, templates, stylesheets, scripts,
verifiers, tests, and project docs should have one clear job and a readable
boundary.

Research/reference artifacts are the only intentional long-form exception.
Generated, vendor, lock, cache, and export files are artifacts, not a design
precedent, and must not be hand-expanded as project logic.

## Required behavior

1. Before adding to a large or broad file, identify the file's current job.
2. If the new work introduces a second unrelated concern, split it into a named
   module, partial, helper, recipe, workstream doc, or capability card.
3. Use search/index assistance before reading or expanding large files:
   `python /home/guidingl/projects/capabilities-framework/tools/monolith_audit.py --root <project-root> --threshold-kb 24 --top 20`.
4. If an existing monolith blocks a full split, keep the immediate change
   surgical and record the split as follow-up in the queue, handoff, lesson, or
   capability card.
5. Do not use generated, vendor, lock, cache, or export files as examples for
   how hand-authored project code should be shaped.
6. Keep research/reference long-form files labeled clearly so agents do not
   mistake them for production structure.

## Failure modes

- A file becomes a dumping ground for unrelated business, UI, data, verifier,
  and documentation concerns.
- Future agents hit truncation or context limits and silently miss important
  sections.
- Tests and verifiers become too broad to identify which behavior failed.
- A small requested change requires reading or editing a whole unrelated
  subsystem.
- Handoffs become unreliable because the relevant logic is hidden inside a
  large file with no clear boundary.
